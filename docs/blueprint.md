## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep indigo (#4F46E5) for a sense of safety, intelligence, and reliability.
- Background color: Light gray (#F9FAFB), to ensure important vitals, notifications and/or risk level information receives appropriate contrast and visibility.
- Accent color: Purple (#8B5CF6), to bring further energy and to call attention to CTAs and important information
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk' sans-serif. This will be used for a contemporary and computerized feel, while allowing easy readability in multiple sizes
- Body font: 'Inter' sans-serif, for a modern, objective, neutral look. The combined choice of Grotesk and Inter will allow enough freedom of expression while still allowing enough ease of use.
- Use modern, minimalist icons for key actions and data points.
- Prioritize a clean, data-rich layout with clear sections for vitals, location, and emergency actions.
- Subtle transitions and animations to indicate data updates and system status changes.
